## Short exercise of building a vowels games

##### They can't all be winners

This is a quick game I built to teach users the difference between vowels and consonants.

It was also an exercise in 2D animation using the built in Unity3D animation tools. I was happy to find that the tools are easy to use and offer fine grain control of animated assets.

Play the game [here](../games/Vowels/vowels.html)
