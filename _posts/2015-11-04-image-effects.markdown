## Short exercise in realism

##### They aren't all losers

This is a quick game I built to explore crating realism in Unity3D with standard assets and scripts. 

I decided to spend an hour playing with the standard assets and image effects after watching a portion of a presentation on image effects at a recent Unite Europe event. 

So that my readers do not think that I am pretending to have written or modelled any of what you see. The only script I touched was the lock cursor script which you can enable by pressing 'm' or 'l.'

The tools that Unity provides standard (and free) are really excellent and easy to use. My one complaint has always been the character controller. For some reason, Unity character controllers are always obtuse and really really bad - no artistry at all. 

Anyway, this was just a bit of fun.
